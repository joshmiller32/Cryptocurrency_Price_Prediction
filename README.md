# Deep Learning Model for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

![deep_learning](./Images/deep-learning.jpg)

A notebook has been created to compare the predictive value of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index versus historical closing prices using a LSTM deep learning model.  Model architecture and parameters were experimented with in order to find the best results.  Models were evaluated using loss scores. A graph of actual values vs predicted values is included in the notebooks.
